# Twitter-Interaction
### A simple interaction with Twitter using its API to tweet, post, search for users, hashtags and trending topics. This project was made to learn more about the language and API requests.
  - There's a library that I made within the project and, next to it, its documentation - which is small and easy. 
  - You will need **oauth2** to have permission to log on to third party sites... like Twitter.
  - You have to have **your own keys** (consumer and token keys) to access **your own application** on the website for twitter developers _(https://developer.twitter.com/)_
    - Note: Each key is unique to each application you create.
